# READ-ME for the python browser MinimalBrowser.
To run this make sure you have Linux.
It doesent matter wich distrobution.
Go to terminal, and type in this command : pip install PyQt5, When it says that you don't have PIP and there is an N/y type y and hit enter.
When that is installed you need to type in this command: pip install PyQtWebEngine.
When that is installed make sure you have IDLE or VSCode or anything that uses Python.
Export the .py file into your window or Python.
And debug (click run and then "Start Debugging") and hit "Run without debugging" (in the "run" menu)
Thanks for using MinimalBrowser.
